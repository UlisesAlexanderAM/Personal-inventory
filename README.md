# Personal inventory

## Description

Web app to use a personal inventory to manage the skills needed for a job position or to keep track of the desired skills.

## Motivation

After watching/taking some courses about how to land a job and personal development I got to a format for a personal inventory that I like, the format was a simple spreadsheet that I modified a little to fit my needs. And ended up with the following columns:

- Habilidades, conocimientos, competencias encontradas en puestos que me interesan (Skills, knowledge, competences found in positions that interest me)
- Grado de confianza (Level of confidence)
- Lugares con mayor inter√©s (Places with greater interest)

But I stumbled upon a problem, I wanted to know which skills appeared in more places with greater interest, I also wanted the skills related to a specific place with greater interest to be color-coded, so I could differentiate them from skills needed for other jobs. Another problem was that there were skills (i.e. Python) that were highly demanded in many places with greater interest so I had to add more columns to keep track of the places with greater interest where the skill was needed.

So I decided to create a web app to solve those problems and change a little the purpose and implementation of the personal inventory. Below I'll write the user stories that I want to implement, diagrams and mockups.

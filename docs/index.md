# Welcome to Personal Inventory

Originally a web app to use as a personal inventory.
Now an API to use create and manage a personal inventory.

???+ info "What's a personal inventory?"
    In this case a personal inventory is a set of skills,
    knowledge and competences that a person has or is
    interested in obtain.

This project primary focus is as a self-hosted API for experimentation and personal
use but as I don't want to delimitate the user, I add a dockerfile and a compose
file so you can deploy it on the cloud.

## From a web app to an API

I came to the conclusion that at the moment I know more about backend development
than frontend development. Another reason is that if the user want to do some highly
personalized websites to show their personal inventories I shouldn't restrict them
to follow my choices of how to display and interact with the personal inventory.

Probably I'll use simple templates with ninja for my personal use and as an simple
example.

## Objectives of the project

This project have some objectives:

- Help me build experience in non-trivial code projects
- Help to know me, and however use this API, better.
- Track skills, knowledge and competences.
- Help to prioritize the learning/practice of skills.
